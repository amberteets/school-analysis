# School District Analysis

## Background and Purpose

In response to evidence of academic dishonesty, a school board commisioned this analysis to determine the effects of invalidating potentially fraudulent scores on the district's performance as a whole. After converting 9th grade Math and Reading scores from Thomas High School to NaN, several summary DataFrames are generated to provide a complete picture of the district's high schools.
